Subject: Sick Leave Request

Dear Sai,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work due to a sudden illness. Regrettably, I will need to take sick leave starting today and extending through tomorrow as well. I will keep you updated on my health progress.

I plan to visit my doctor and will follow their recommendations regarding the duration of my leave. I will ensure that all my pending tasks are up to date and will hand over any important responsibilities to [Colleague's Name] during my absence.

I apologize for any inconvenience my absence might cause and thank you for your understanding. Please let me know if there are any forms or formalities I need to complete from my side.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
